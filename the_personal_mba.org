** Profit
   - In addition to compensating owners, profit provides a cushion to handle
     uncertainty and change.
** Profit margin
   - Percentage of revenue the ends up as profit
   - c.f. markup: percentage of cost that you add onto cost for the price
** Value capture
   - Capturing some percentage of value provided in every transaction (as
     profit or otherwise)
   - Value capture maximization: capture as much of value as possible
     - High short term gain, little value to customer
   - Value capture minimization: capture as little value as possible as long
     as business is sufficient
     - Small short term gains, high value to customer, hopefully translates to
       high loyalty
** Sufficiency
   - Point where the business is bringing enough profit that the business
     owners find it worth sustaining
** Valuation
   - Estimate of total worth of a company
   - Capital raised depends on valuation
   - Perceived value affects valuation
** Cash flow statement
   - Bank account over time
   - Three primary areas of cash movement
     - Operations
     - Investing
     - Financing
   - Cash contributes to the Resiliency of the business
** Income statement
   - Cash is not profit
   - Cash flow analysis can be misleading if business manages inventory or
     extends credit to customers
   - Accrual accounting: revenue recognized when sale is made and expenses
     associated incurred at same time period
   - Income statement / Profit and loss statement / operating statement
     earnings statement
     - Revenue - Cost of goods sold - expenses - taxes = Net profit
     - Includes many estimates and assumptions
** Balance sheet
   - Assets - liabilities = Owner's equity
** Financial ratios
   - Financial ratios
     - Comparison between two important elements of the business
   - Profitability ratios
     - Ability to generate profit
     - profit margin
       - (revenue - cost) / cost
     - return on assets
       - net profit / total assets
   - Leverage ratios
     - debt to equity
       - total liabilities / shareholders' equity
   - Liquidity ratios
     - ability of a business to pay its bills
     - current ratio
       - current assets / current liabilities
     - quick ratio
       - (current assets - inventory) / current liabilities
     - efficiency ratios
       - how well a business is managing assets and liabilities
       - inventory management
         - too little / too much is bad
     - lotsa different ratios, which to focus on depends on industry
** Cost-benefit analysis
   - examining potential changes to business to see if benefits outweigh costs
     - evaluate true cost of an action
   - important to include nonfinancial costs as well, e.g. enjoyment
   - Small costs and small benefits accumulate
** Four methods to increase revenue
   1. Increase your customers
   2. Increase average size of each Transaction
   3. Increase frequency of transactions per customer
   4. Raise prices
   - Qualification: not every customer is a good customer
** Pricing power
   - Ability to raise prices over time (less value captured, greater pricing
     power)
     - Related to "price elasticity"
   - e.g. luxury goods have good pricing power since their prices are
     expensive social signals
   - Unless you have accurate norms, you don't know how much pricing power
     you have
   - Prices rarely have permanent effects if you aren't very public
   - Experiment to find what works
   - Important to overcome inflation and increased costs, resulting in need
     for more currency to increase business's Sufficiency needs (hopefully
     your customers have increased purchasing power too)
** Lifetime value
   - Value of a customer over their entire relationship with your company
   - Subscriptions maximize lifetime value
** Allowable acquisition cost (AAC)
   - Marketing component of lifetime value
   - Subscription means that it's ok to lose money on first sale
   - AAC: ((Lifetime value - value stream - overhead) / customer base) * (1 - profit margin)
** Overhead
   - Minimum ongoing resources required for operation
   - Critical component if capital is fixed (determines burn rate)
** Costs: fixed and variable
   - Fixed costs
     - Reductions in fixed costs accumulate
   - Variable costs
     - Amplified by volume
** Incremental degradation
   - Cost savings accumulate in their degraded quality. Cutting costs that
     are wasteful is good, but soon runs into diminishing returns
** Breakeven
   - Systems need to be created during ramp-up
** Amortization
   - Amortization: spreading cost of resources over estimated useful life
** Purchasing power
   - Sum total of all liquid assets
** Cash flow cycle
   - How cash flows through a business
   - Receivables: promises of payment
   - Debt: promise to pay
   - Increase purchasing power by taking on debt
   - More purchasing power means more resilient
** Opportunity cost
   - Value given up by making a decision
   - Absence blindness
   - Analyzing opportunity costs too much can lead to diminishing returns
** Time value of money
   - Compounding
   - Informs decisions in the face of opportunity costs
** Compounding
   - Accumulation of games over time: positive feedback loop
** Leverage
   - Using borrowed money to magnify potential gains
   - Financial amplification
** Hierarchy of funding
   - Funding: tocket fuel; good when business is pointed in right direction,
     but if structural issues exist, it's not good
   - Capital providers look for value and control in return
   - Hierarchy of funding
     - Personal cash
     - Personal credit
     - Personal loans
     - Unsecured loans
     - Secured loans
     - Bonds
     - Receivables financing
     - Angel capital
     - Venture capital
     - Public stock offering
** Bootstraping
   - Building a business without funding
   - Accept funding only to do things you can't do any other way
** Return on investment (ROI)
   - Value created from an investment
   - Concept can be applied to other universal currencies:
     - Return on invested time
** Sunk cost
   - Investments that cannot be recovered
** Internal controls
   - Standard operating procedures to collect accurate data, smooth ops
   - Budgets very important in controlling profit margins, cash flow cycle,
     leverage
   - Supervision important if business rely on employees
   - Compliance necessary when regulated
   - Theft and fraud prevention: agains trisk of financial loss
* The human mind

   - Get 7-8 hrs sleep; helps pattern matching and mental simulation,
     reverses willpower depletion
