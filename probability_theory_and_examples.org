   Let Omega be a set of "outcomes"
   Let F be a set of "events" where F is a sigma-field / sigma-algebra of Omega
   Let P: F -> [0,1] be a function that assigns probabilities to events.

   A probability space is a triple (Omega, F, P)

   A sigma-field is a nonempty collection of subsets of Omega that satisfy

   - If A in F then A' in F (A' is the complement of A in Omega)
   - If A[i] is a countable sequence of sets then Un[i] A[i] in F.
   - Then we also have In[i] A[i] in F.

   A measurable space is a tuple (Omega, F)

   A measure is a function mu : F -> R with

   - mu(A) >= mu(null) = 0 for all A in F
   - For a disjoint countable sequence A[i] in F,
     mu(Un[i] A[i]) = Sum[i] mu(A[i])

   If mu(Omega) = 1, then it is also a probability measure.

   Theorem 1.1.1

   - monotonicity if A subst B then mu(A) <= mu(B)
   - subadditivity if A subst Un[m=1..inf] A[m]
     then mu(A) <= Sum[m=1..inf] mu(A[m])
   - continuity from below if A[i] tends to A from below,
     mu(A[i]) tends to mu(A) from below
   - continuity from above if A[i] tends to A from above and mu(A[1]) < infty
     then mu(A[i]) tends to mu(A) from above.

   A[i] tends to A from below if (A[1] subst A[2] subst ... A[i] and
   Un[i]A[i] = A)

   A[i] tends to A from above if (A[i] supst A[2] supst ... A[i] and
   In[i]A[i] = A)
