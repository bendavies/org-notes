* Part I Introduction
** 1 Introduction
   - adaptive social systems :: interactive, thoughtful agents
   - complex adaptive social system :: understanding local action within the
        social system may not lead to understanding another part of/entire system
   - science of complexity :: our goal (perhaps in the sense of Aristotle's
   categories?)

   stuff
   - history
     - the wealth of nations: Smith's "invisible hand"
     - Arrow/Dereu's formalisms of the invisible hand
     - over the years, original theoretical notions driving investication are
       crowded out by an increasing focus on tool adeptness; we have smart but
       not wise science (complicated, little predictive power)
   - present social science
     - static, homogeneous situations comprising of very few smart or
       very many dumb agents, that do not change much over time
   - complex systems research has given rise to new computational techniques
     that enable more models to be explored
   - tools and ideas complement existing approaches

** A An open agenda for complex adaptive social systems
*** A.1 Whither complexity
*** A.2 What does it take for a system to exhibit complex behavior?
*** A.3 Is there an objective basis for recognizing emergence and complexity?
    (Pre-reading thoughts of Johannes: patterns are the modulation of
    physical dimensions; these patterns themselves can be quantized/mapped
    as dimensions themselves; different modulations can be performed on the
    same physical dimension to give rise to separate patterns and separate
    pattern-dimensions; each of which
    are dimensions of themselves; agents naturally exist on/are defined by
    a substrate of multiple dimensions; some of which matter much to the
    internal function of the agent, some of which are not.
    Emergence is when the ordering of agents themselves form a pattern.
