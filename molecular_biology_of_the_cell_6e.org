* TODO Part I Introduction to the cell
** TODO Chapter 1 Cells and Genomes

   - cell biology :: study of the structure, function and behavior of cells

   Two themes in biology
   - Diversity in individual particulars, regularity in fundamental mechanisms

*** TODO The universal features of cells on earth

    All cells have the following properties
    - hereditary info contained in DNA
      - Polymers of ACTG.
    - perform DNA replication to replicate hereditary info
      - polymerization :: creating a new polymer (in this case DNA, RNA)
      - nucleotide :: the monomer of DNA
    - transcribe genes in DNA into RNA
      - gene expression :: transcribing the gene into rna
      - RNA :: has U in place of T, are disposable
        - mRNA :: molecules that guide the synthesis of proteins; encodes codons
        - might have distinctive chemical structure
    - use proteins as catalysts
      - amino acids :: monomers of proteins
      - polypeptide :: polymers of amino acids
      - enzyme :: protein acting in the capacity of a catalyst
    - RNA translation is the same in all life
      - codon :: sequence of 3 nucleotides that encode an amino acid
      - tRNA :: anticodons, that are base-paired with mRNA
      - ribosome :: the machine that translates RNA to protein
    - Genes encode DNA
      - gene :: DNA segments that are eventually expressed into proteins
      - regulatory DNA :: DNA segments onto which proteins are bound,
                          thereby controlling transcription
      - genome :: an organism's inventory of genes
    - require free energy
    - are biochemical factories dealing with the same basic molecular building
      blocks
    - enclose in a plasma membrane
      - consists of amphiphilic phospholipid molecules
      - membrane transport proteins :: proteins embedded in the membrane that
           allow partial transport of chemicals
    - exist cells living with fewer than 500 genes
      - Mycoplasma genitalium

*** TODO The diversity of genomes and the tree of life
    - organotrophic :: feed on other living things
    - phototrophic :: feed on sunlight
    - lithotrophic :: feed on energy-rich inorganic chemicals
