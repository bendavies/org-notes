* Preface to the 1996 edition
  - 1968-08-21 violent ending to Marxism with a Human Face
  - Disruption of democratic convention in Chicago by protestors
  - Berkeley campus: confrontations between students and Reagan's administration
  - Frankfurt School emerging into public consciousness of New Left
  - c.f. Weather Underground
  - 1969-02 Frankfurt had buildings occupied for improvised Marxist courses
  - The first edition of this book was written in such a supercharged climate
    - 1960 hopes and fears still potent
    - Vietnam War still ongoing
    - New Left still has some force
    - Western Marxism was still new; translations still new
    - Written by an outsider with no prior investment in its ideas or personal
      debts to its members
    - Western Marxism soon declined after 1970s
  - Second generation of Frankfurt School
    - Habermas, Alfred Schmidt, Albrecht Wellmer
  - Third generation
    - TODO
  - recession of 1973; restructuring of world economic system
    - bankruptcy of Eastern socialism
    - abandonment of Keynesian-Fordist economic policies
    - Harvey: rise of "flexible accumulation"
      - growing importance of international finance capital against the
        increasingly impotent nation state; globalization of labor markets
        leading to accelerated migration of cheap foreign labor, weakening of
        trade union movement; compression of time and space through technology;
        blunting of capitalism's tendency to overaccumulate through the temporal
        and soatial displacement of demand.
      - seems to produce crises neither controllable by a conscious steering
        mechanism nor able to generate a collective social actor (like the
        Marxist proletariat) able to challenge it from within
      - c.f. Offe, 1985; Disorganized Capitalism
      - Postone, Moishe, 1993; Time, Labor, and Social Domination
    - interest in Frankfurt school resides mainly among Anglo postmodernism
    - sorta prepared the intellectual milleu for postmodernism by throwing away
      concepts such as impending emancipation in favor of complex narratives
    - critique of western tradition of instrumental, technological rationality
      c.f. "Dialectic of Enlightenment", seems to have commonality with
      postmodernism
    - blah blah of FF v. PoMo
    - Reading Ardono sees the anticipation of PoMo
    - c.f. Russell Jacoby
* Foreword by Max Horkheimer
  - Work of Frankfurt before emigration possible thanks to Hermann Weil
    and son's support
  - Interested in formulating the negative in the epoch of transition; critical
    approach to existing society
  - Marxist interpretation still dominant, but not dogmatic
  - Desire to appeal to an entirely Other than this world
* Introduction
  - commonplace to regard academia as alienated
  - alienation can be a highly valued commodity
  - existentialism was a breath of fresh air, now cliche
  - American culture's ability to absorb, coopt and defuse opponents
  - intellectuals who value their critical function are finding it challenging
  - intellectuals are already actors; engaged in symbolic action;
    externalization of thought
  - critical edge comes from gap between the symbol and the reality; at worst
    by wanting to bridge the gap between ideal and reality, their work becomes
    propaganda.
  - Perfection of the life or perfection of the work
  - The radical intellectual identifying too closely with popular forces
    jeapordizes achieving either perfection
  - Frankfurt school deeply sensitive to cooptation.
  - Balanced refusal to compromise theoretical integrity while seeking to
    identify social actor to realize their ideas
  - Essential coherence in FS's thought; common vocabulary and shared
    assumptions
* Acknowledgements
* 1 The creation of the Institut f√ºr Sozialforschung and its first Frankfurt years
  - WWI shifted socialism eastward; left-wing European intellectuals could
    either support Weimar (non-revolutionary) or accept Moscow's leadership
  - relation of theory to praxis: praxis is a kind of self-creating action
    (not from extrinsic motivation)
  - praxis in Marxist usage is often theoretically informed; revolution seen as
    unifying of theory and praxis (denied by Weimar's bourgeois compromise)
  - Soviet leadership soon became more concerned for survival than socialist
    aims. Similar for Weimar.
  - Felix Weil supported radical ventures.
  - First was Erste Marxistsche Arbeitswoche (EMA); a week to discuss Marxism
  - Horkheimer x Pollock
  - Felix Weil founded the IfS, instituting Gerlach as head.
